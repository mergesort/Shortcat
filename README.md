## Todo

- [ ] Finish UICollectionView support
- [ ] A better README
- [ ] Demo gif
- [ ] Push to CocoaPods

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the great work [@donohue](https://github.com/donohue) did for [IPShortcut](https://github.com/Instapaper/IPShortcut).

#### Advantages over IPShortcut:

- Uses protocols/extensions to add support any UIViewController with just a few lines of code rather than subclassing.
- Supports multiple sections which IPShortcut does not presently.
- I wrote it so now I get to maintain it. Can't wait to see how that goes. \o/

#### Disadvantages:
- Not Objective-C compatible.
- It's not written by Brian, who is a wonderful fella.


## Installation
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `Shortcat` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```swift

Or install it manually by downloading the Swift files in the `Source` folder, and dropping them in your project.
